# CONTRIBUTIONS ONLY

**What does this mean?** I do not have time to fix issues myself. The only way fixes or new features will be added is by people submitting PRs. If you are interested in taking over maintenance and have a history of contributions to Kingpin, please let me know.

**Current status.** Kingpin is largely feature stable. There hasn't been a need to add new features in a while, but there are some bugs that should be fixed.

**Why?** I no longer use Kingpin personally (I now use [kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong)). Rather than leave the project in a limbo of people filing issues and wondering why they're note being worked on, I believe this notice will more clearly set expectations.
